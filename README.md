### config.json template

 We recommend using an admin user

```
{
    "browser": "Chrome",
    "type": "local",
    "implicit_wait": 10,
    "url_remote": "http://localhost:4444/wd/hub",
    "environment": "https://crmenvironment.apprubeus.com.br",
    "valid_user": "usuario@rubeus.com.br",
    "valid_password": "123exemplo"
}
```  

## Folder Structure

The `components/common` folder contains all the components used throughout the application, each feature will have its own `/components` folder if that component is very specific and will not be used again.

### Component specific folder

- Structure

- **/components**
  - _Global components here..._

- **/pages**
  - **/auth**
    - **/components**

  - **/dashboard**
    - **/components**

Just follow this pattern for specific components, otherwise throw everything in the `/components/common` folder
